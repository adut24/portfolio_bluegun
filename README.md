## Introduction
This is our portfolio project to end our foundations year at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com). We chose to develop a 2D top-down pixel art Rogue-like game on the [Unity](https://unity.com) engine.

### What's a Rogue-like game?
Rogue-like games are a subgenre of video game characterized by **dungeon crawling** through **procedurally generated** levels with **permanent death** of the player. *Rogue* (1980), is the forerunner of the subgenre and gave it its name.

More recent popular Rogue-like games are: *[The Binding of Isaac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Binding_of_Isaac_(video_game))* (2011), *[Spelunky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelunky)* (2008), *[Hades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hades_(video_game))* (2020) or the *[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Mystery_Dungeon)* (2005) series inspired by the Japanese game series *[Mystery Dungeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Dungeon)* (1993).

### What is Bluegun like?
In *Bluegun*, you play as a mage. This mage goes through a number of procedurally generated rooms to obtain different weapons, armors or artifacts to make yourself more powerful and resistant to the hordes of enemies trying to stop you from going further.

You go through each room, one at a time inspired by *Hades* on that aspect, with the enemies becoming stronger and stronger as you advance.

## Download
Here are the links to download the game depending on the operating system you are using:
- [Windows]()
- [Linux]()
- [MacOS]()

**Currently none of the links work as we didn't release any builds yet**.

## Usage
To launch the game, go inside the folder downloaded in the previous step and double click on the executable file named after the game.

## Related projects
During our foundations year, we didn't work on projects remotely close to this one, as it's the first time we worked on a game and Unity with C#.

As for how we organized ourselves, the only project we did the three of us together was the [Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/Pierre-Dureau/sorting_algorithms) project in C.

## Special Thanks
A huge thanks to the people on sites like [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/) and [itch.io](https://itch.io/), which provide usage-free sprites with animations or assets.
